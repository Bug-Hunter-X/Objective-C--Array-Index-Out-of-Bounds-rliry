This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C error: accessing an array element beyond its valid index. The `bug.m` file contains code that attempts to access the 5th element of an array that may have fewer than 5 elements. This results in an exception and a crash.  The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version that checks the array's bounds before attempting to access elements.
