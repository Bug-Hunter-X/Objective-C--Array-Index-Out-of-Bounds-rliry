This code attempts to access an array element outside its bounds.  It assumes that `myArray` always has at least 5 elements, which isn't guaranteed.  If `myArray` has fewer than 5 elements, this will result in an out-of-bounds exception. 

```objectivec
NSArray *myArray = @[@1, @2, @3];
NSInteger value = [myArray objectAtIndex:4]; // This will crash if myArray.count < 5
NSLog("Value at index 4: %ld", (long)value);
```
